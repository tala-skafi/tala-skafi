- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @tala-skafi

I'm a  hard worker, self-learning girl who aims to expand her knowledge in many fields,
especially in IT and computer engineering,
and continuously improve herself, 
I can make a big difference wherever I go.

I'm interested in working as a developer, 
I like programming and making web pages, making algorithms,
and making proper solutions, but also,
I'm interested in hardware too.
